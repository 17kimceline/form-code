# FORM + CODE

I created a smoll galaxy. Looking through Code Pen, I was very inspired by one work
by ScieCode. Here is a link to the pen https://codepen.io/sciecode/pen/QzMPgr
The code from the above artist is used in 'backgroundAura'

<br/>
This every changing portal in this galaxy regenerates every time you refresh. 
The triangle spaceships swim around in anti-gravity. 
They slow down and become smaller as they float 'further away'. With this piece, 
I was mainly playing around with how scale and speed can alter a person's perspective of a 2D animation. 

Hope you enjoy!
