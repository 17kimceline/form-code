# FORM + CODE

I created a smoll galaxy. Looking through Code Pen, I was very inspired by one work
by ScieCode. Here is a link to the pen https://codepen.io/sciecode/pen/QzMPgr

<br/>
The every changing portal in this galaxy regenerates every time you refresh with
random variation of arcs and arc thickness. The circle cotton balls swim around in anti-gravity. 
They slow down and become smaller as they float 'further away'. With this piece, 
I was mainly playing around with how scale and speed can alter a person's perspective of a 2D animation.
